                                <p class="portfolio-desc">
                                    Lacquer thread sculpture is the heritage of ancient Buddhist sculpture art, it was inspired by the lacquer thread technology of Song and Yuan dynasties, especially the Drain powder and clay line carving skills.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Lacquer thread carving uses fine lacquer thread with special production methods to wind out a variety of resplendent figures and animal images, especially the folk traditional themes, such as dragon, phoenix, kylin, clouds, water, twining branches, lotus, etc. In the past, lacquer line sculpture was mostly confined to wooden lacquer baskets and theatrical props, but now it has developed to be decorated on porcelain and glassware.
                                    <br><br>
                                    In this documentary video, my groupmate visited Master Chen Wen Long in Hongtang, Xike Town, Tong 'an District, Xiamen city to closely learn more about lacquer thread sculpture culture. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Due to the epidemic and the distance, one of my groupmates and I were unable to interview them, therefore we were in responsible of processing the raw video footage captured by them. My editing portion begins at 4:18, after which I hand it off to my groupmate for post-processing and subtitles.

                                    This short video narrates the story of an designer whose client frequently requests that she make changes to the design of her project file. She rapidly completed the adjustments to her project at the client's urging. Due to exhaustion, she accidentally sent the first project file that she had given in previously, but the customer requested advanced design adjustments on it. In the end, the client is satisfied with the design of that project file, but the designer felt her efforts were for nothing.
